                    prior to the first King of Iron Fist Tournament, Doctor Bosconovitch became absorbed in his work and
                    did not notice how ill his daughter was. After being away from home for several days at work,
                    Bosconovitch returned home to discover that his daughter had died. Consumed by grief, he isolated
                    himself deep in Siberia and began attempting to make an immortal android replica of his daughter. He
                    developed cold sleep technology to preserve the body of his daughter, and succeeded in creating a
                    flexible metal alloy that was similar to human skin - however, before he could complete his work, he
                    was captured by the KGB and forced to create robotic weapons for the Soviet (later Russian)
                    military.</p>

                    Kazuya was born the son of Heihachi Mishima and Kazumi Mishima and raised on the Mishima Estate, the
                    Mishima Clan's enormous aristocratic home in Japan. Kazuya's mother loved and doted on him, as did
                    Kazuya's grandfather, Jinpachi Mishima, who also taught him Mishima Style Fighting Karate from a
                    young age. Kazuya's life took a turn for the worse however when he was five years old. First, his
                    beloved grandfather disappeared (Kazuya would later discover he was imprisoned by Heihachi under the
                    family temple, after Jinpachi failed to retake the Mishima Zaibatsu from Heihachi, who had
                    previously launched a coup against him). Then, Kazuya's mother was killed by Heihachi. Unbeknown to
                    Kazuya, his mother had been tasked with stopping Heihachi from going down a warmongering path at all
                    costs. When her cause seemed lost, she fell into a series of illnesses, and was eventually taken
                    over by a demonic alter ego which attempted to kill Heihachi.</p>

                    Reina entered the King of Iron Fist Tournament 8’s Asia Preliminaries. In the arena, she met Jin
                    Kazama, Heihachi’s grandson, and introduced herself to him. Jin ignored her, but they were matched
                    against one another in the semifinals. Reina knew that the Mishima Style Fighting Karate she used in
                    battle had contributed to the awakening of Jin’s devil powers at Heihachi's hands in the past.
                    During their fight, Jin’s powers activated, and Reina concluded that the ‘threat of death’ was key
                    to unlocking a devil’s power. She then forfeited the match, having seen all she needed to. Later,
                    she approached Jin in the arena again, telling him she wanted to help take down Kazuya Mishima. Jin
                    was suspicious of her intentions, given her fighting style, but she brushed his concerns off.</p>
